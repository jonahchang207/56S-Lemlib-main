# 56S-Lemlib-main

VEX V5 robotics control system for Team 56S built with LemLib and PROS for competitive autonomous navigation and precision control.

## Overview

This repository contains the competition code for Team 56S's VEX V5 robot. The project leverages the LemLib motion library to implement advanced odometry tracking, PID-based movement, and autonomous routines for VEX Robotics Competition (V5RC).

## Features

- **LemLib Motion Control**: Advanced path following and odometry algorithms
- **Autonomous Routines**: Competition-ready autonomous sequences
- **PID Controllers**: Tuned lateral and angular PID for precise movement
- **Odometry Tracking**: Real-time position tracking using IMU and tracking wheels
- **Driver Control**: Optimized control schemes for competitive play
- **PROS Integration**: Built on the PROS kernel for reliable performance

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: PROS (Professional Robot Operating System)
- **Library**: LemLib v0.5.0+
- **Language**: C++
- **Platform**: VEX V5 Brain

## Hardware Requirements

- VEX V5 Brain
- VEX V5 Smart Motors
- VEX V5 Inertial Sensor (IMU)
- Optional: Tracking wheels for enhanced odometry accuracy

## Installation

## Configuration

### Robot Setup
Configure your robot's hardware in the source files:
- Motor ports and gearing
- IMU port
- Tracking wheel configuration (if applicable)
- Chassis dimensions and wheel diameter

### PID Tuning
Tune the PID controllers for optimal performance:
- Lateral PID (forward/backward movement)
- Angular PID (turning)
- Adjust constants in the chassis configuration

## Usage

### Autonomous Mode
Select autonomous routines from the V5 brain screen during competition. Routines are pre-programmed for optimal scoring.

### Driver Control
Standard tank or arcade drive controls configured for competition driving.
